# pokedexLockout
Tracker for pokemon catch 'em all lockout (lockout bingo with pokedexes)

Now supports Kanto pokedex or Johto (including all kanto pokemon)
It uses Web rtc to connect to the other person and I'm not hosting any server to find people so you have to do the handshake semi-manually.
I tried to make it easy though, basically just send the text it gives you to the other person over some sort of IM and follow the directions
